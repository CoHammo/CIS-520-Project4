Nighttime is a great kingdom of sounds
Be quiet and listen so it can be found
It starts when the bugs begin their rounds
And the frogs croak from on their mounds
As the crickets start to chirp and tweedle
The other bugs join and thread their melodic needle
When the frogs jump in their voices are deep
But the music they improve by a great leap
Continue listening and the kingdom will grow
For a river of noises must surely flow
Soon more animals bring tidings, and lo!
Their subjects of sound do mightily glow
An owl or two might soon make a hoot
And you know an owl's words can never be moot
Once the sounds have grown the coyotes then howl
Though it be haunting their voices aren't foul
